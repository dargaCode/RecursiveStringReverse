# Recursive String Reverse
Recursively reverse a given string using strcpy, strcat, and calloc.

C is a harsh mistress. Despite having completed a nearly identical project in JS 3 months ago, I had several false starts on this one.

I had to go back and do several smaller projects related to strings (as well as get some advice on reddit) before I could finish it.

In any event I learned a ton this month, especially on this project.
